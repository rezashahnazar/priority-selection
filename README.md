# priority-selection
A simple python code to determine the best possible "position" (e.g. University) for each student, based on their score and priorities.

The CSV file contains information about 8 sample students: 'name', 'score' , priorities ('o1' to 'o4')

4 possible positions (called UNIS) are "t" , "s" , "i" and "b".
Each position is considered to have 2 empty sites primarily.
